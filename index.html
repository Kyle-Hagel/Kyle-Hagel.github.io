				<h2>About Me</h2>
				<p>
					When someone says a situation is hopeless I will always be the last man on a team to give up hope, because no matter what goes wrong I will keep fighting to put out a product I can be proud of, and I will make the best of a bad situation.

					I have built computers for personal use and set up servers for community projects. I have experience working with people's needs in a business setting weather it be settling disputes amongst team members in a fast and efficient fashion, communicating between a development team and management or a client. I also have experience working with users remotely over the phone or email to resolve their issues and decipher the nature of their issues.

				<h2>Skills</h2>
				<p>
					I have used many languages over the years in an assortment of IDEs and also by plain text. I tend to prefer languages that have less overhead, which happen to be the ones that require the most knowledge and skill to use well, but I am willing to adapt to the most efficient tools for a given job. Currently I have studied:

				<h2>My Priorities, in order</h2>
				
				<p>
					I have the most fun working in web development currently. My particular passion in this field is User Experience and I enjoy designing effect and intuitive page layouts rather than sticking to a tried and true template. I feel there are many creative solutions to basic user issues that often go overlooked, and that users can be retained through ease of use just as well as the actual services delivered.
				</p>
				
				<ol>
					<li>
						<strong>All Inclusive/Cross Platform</strong>
						<p>
							I strongly believe that dedicating your work to any one platform limits your consumer base. Many products that struggle to make a place on the most common platform can garner a reputation via other platforms that see less support. Being multi-platform is one of the best ways to make get a foothold in the market.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Out-Of-the-Box Functionality</strong>
						<p>
							You can make a great first impression with a customer by surprising them with self-sufficient code. Users often put it in terms such as “it just works”, when a program is able to intuitively detect and automatically configure the users needs without overstepping. There is no greater loss of product value than making the user feel like your product will be a chore to use.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Design</strong>
						<p>
							A strong well thought out design is often the make or break of a project's success. It is important to make sure that all development team members are on the same page about wat is being done, how and why. A project that lacks sufficient design will be inconsistent within itself which is frustrating for the end user and often result in them being hesitant to work without products in the future.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Lightweight</strong>
						<p>
							Coding efficiency is something we see fading in the industry. More and more new developers inflate the size of their code to absurd degrees because the memory and disk space is becoming more accessible. I do not believe developing technology to be an excuse to work less efficiently. Bloated code takes up more company resources at an exponential rate. As an admirer of old programming techniques I strive find techniques to make more effective that requires less storage and processing power.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Modularity</strong>
						<p>
							Well defined and interchangeable components hold great value in development. Putting a little extra work into a component more robust of self-sufficient will go a long way when it can be used and repurposed for other projects down the line. A well planned Modular design can also be altered to suit updates to the project needs or scope quite quickly with minimal loss.

		        <h2>Who do I think I Am?</h2>
		        <p>
		            I feel I have lived a harder life than most. I have always had to work verry hard to overcome many unusual obstacles brought about by my less than fortunate upbringing. In many ways I am stronger for these struggles, but I have learned the hard way that overwork can be bad for your health. I am still learning to pace myself, and it is difficult to do, because every setback in life fuels my desire to become a better person and achieve things I can be proud of in whatever field I work in.:
		        </p>
		        <ul>
		            <li>Programing and technical support for open community projects(small applications)</li>
		            <li>Writing (comedy, drama)</li>
		            <li>Video Editing</li>
		            <li>Origami</li>
		            <li>Miscellaneous research on cultural/historical topics (Anything from political history, old cultural mythos, to failed science experiments and what we can take away from them)</li>
